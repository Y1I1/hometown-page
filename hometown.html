          <h4>Visit Coventry Cathedral</h4>
          <p>
            Visitors are always welcome at Coventry Cathedral and they have a trained team of Welcomers, Guides and Chaplains to help you feel comfortable in your exploration. You don't need to be of any particular faith to enjoy a visit here nor in fact of any faith at all: it's as beautiful an experience from an architectural perspective as it is from a religious one.
